"","","Came here for the first time today on my lunch break - was a massive fan of this place when it was Farnham Grill & was gutted when they closed! I was served by a man (didn't get his name) but he was very attentive and polite and mindful of my allergies! he reviewed my order with me before I paid, but I suspected it to be a bit pricey considering I ordered a meal and a small Pizza. Didn't realise until i got my order that they randomly added a lamb donner roll in as well which is why it was so pricey! I never mentioned this at all, and neither did he when he read my order out before I paid! Didn't ask for a refund as I couldn't be bothered with the hassle on my 30 min lunch break.
The chips were under cooked as well and the wrap had no bbq sauce despite being a bbq wrap :( Was hoping it would be like Farnham Grill just vamped up, but it wasn't at all. The atmosphere and service was nice even though they overcharged me for something I didn't order. I might try something else from the menu next time but it is more on the pricey side for what I was served. I do miss the previous Uncle who ran the previous shop - would recommend that supplier for chips than the current one!",""
"","","Peculiar experience-
Place has had some what of a refresh since it was last open.

Welcomed in by a hoard of people, all of them maybe a touch over friendly. I was told that it was my shop, my home etc, but all i really wanted to know about was the food.

This place has a solid menu concept, but executes it poorly.

I spent 5 minutes watching staff members fiddle around writing on bags/boxes....Hint- i know what i have ordered....and will go through it myself.

The food itself:

Chicken burger- Meh. - tough...returned due to eyelash being found.
Chips.- Meh- undercooked...
Pizza- remember those kids school trips, where you could create your own pizza?...yep...that...plus a solid bit of beard weaved in and amongst the cheese...
Wings- Didn't even bother...

I ended up popping back after unsuccessfully trying to contact the store (phone dialled out 5/7 times despite the shop being empty).

The manager seemed to be in fervent denial of the possibility of any form of hair being in the food.....didn't bother apologising...then sat down to his laptop...his perplexed staff (all 3500) of them....watched as another colleague fiddled around with a card machine...and ended up giving cash as a refund.

To conclude...probably won't return...these guys are over complicating the basics... good luck all!",""
